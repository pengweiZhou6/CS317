[/2] Basic query to a name server that is authoritative.
    (e.g. www.cs.ubc.ca to 142.103.6.6)

    
[/5] Basic Query that starts at root server and works to an
       authoritative server in a straightforward path.
       (e.g. www.cs.ubc.ca to a root name server)

    
[/5] A basic type query that results in a CNAME and the need to
    restart the search for the alias. (e.g. prep.ai.mit.edu)

    
[/3] A query that returns a name server to use where the name
    server's address isn't provided. (e.g. www.stanford.edu)

    
[/3] A complicated lookup series that potentially involves multiple CNAMEs
   and NS lookups (finance.google.ca)

    
[0/3] Can deal with information in the additional information
   section when not all of it is of interest/use
   (e.g. groups.yahoo.com)

    
[0/3] Can deal with unconventional but valid response records
  (e.g. uncompressed RR names, compression of the query name).

    
[/3] Adds all resource records in the additional section to the cache

    
[/2] Uses cached data when available (for a regular query).

    
[/3] Uses cached data when available (for a CNAME query).

    
[/2] The TTL reported is the last TTL from the A (or AAAA) record when a CNAME is involved.

    
[0/2] Uses IPv4 nameserver even when IPv6 request is done.

    
[/2] If a query returns more than IP address all IP addresses are printed.

    
[0/2] Is able to properly request and parse A, AAAA, NS and CNAME records.

    



Error Handling: [4/8]
